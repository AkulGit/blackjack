# Blackjack (Python)

A simple Blackjack game I built in Python to practice OOP and terminal-based game logic. Runs entirely in your terminal, no fancy graphics.

## How to Play

- You start with $1000 in virtual cash.
- Before each round, place a bet.
- You and the dealer each get two cards.
- Type `Hit` to take another card or `Stand` if you’re feeling lucky with what you’ve got.
- If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose your bet :(
- The dealer draws until reaching 17 or higher.
- The winner is decided based on who is closer to 21 without busting.

## Files

- `blackjack.py` – Main game file.
- `README.md` – You're reading it.

## Concepts Used

- Python classes and objects
- `__init__` constructor
- Loops and conditional logic
- User input and validation
- OOP design patterns
- Terminal game logic
